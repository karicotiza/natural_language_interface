Название: STARRY NIGHT
#1: The Starry Night, a moderately abstract landscape painting (1889) of an expressive night sky over a small hillside village, one of Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh’s most celebrated works.
#2: The oil-on-canvas painting is dominated by a night sky roiling with chromatic blue swirls, a glowing yellow crescent moon, and stars rendered as radiating orbs.
#3: One or two cypress trees, often described as flame-like, tower over the foreground to the left, their dark branches curling and swaying to the movement of the sky that they partly obscure.
#4: Amid all this animation, a structured village sits in the distance on the lower right of the canvas.
#5: Straight controlled lines make up the small cottages and the slender steeple of a church, which rises as a beacon against rolling blue hills.
#6: The glowing yellow squares of the houses suggest the welcoming lights of peaceful homes, creating a calm corner amid the painting’s turbulence.
#7: Van Gogh painted The Starry Night during his 12-month stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France, several months after suffering a breakdown in which he severed a part of his own ear with a razor.
#8: While at the asylum, he painted during bursts of productivity that alternated with moods of despair.
#9: Although van Gogh’s subjects were restricted, his style was not.
#10: By the time van Gogh arrived at Saint-Rémy, he had already painted a few night scenes, including Starry Night (Rhône) (1888).
